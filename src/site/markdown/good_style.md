# Good Styles

## What makes a good comment/ commit message

### 7 rules for good git commit messages
   1. Line between summary/heading and main text
   Short summary/Heading
   *Empty row*
   Main text
   Short message may only have
   one heading line
   22
2. Short summary/heading less than 50 characters
   • Rough rule
   • Maybe too many changes in commit if not possible
   23
3. Short summary/heading start with capital letter
   24
4. No . at end of short summary/heading
   25
5. Use imperative mood in summary
   Examples:
   Merge branch „feature42“
   Refactor subsystem X for readability
   Update getting started documentation
   Remove deprecated methods
   Release version 1.0.0
   Good summaries should complete the following sentence:
   If applied, this commit will .. .
   26
6. Main text should line break after 72 characters
   27
7. In main text describe what and why and not how
